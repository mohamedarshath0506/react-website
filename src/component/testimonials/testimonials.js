            me find a healthy routine that put me on track towards changing my
            career path. Now, I’m doing something that I always wanted to do.”

            adult. Taxes, work – the stuff they don’t teach you at school. I
            gained confidence, started taking more chances, and am even working
            towards getting into college.”
